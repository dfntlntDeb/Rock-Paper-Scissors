# Rock Paper Scissors Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game I made using **Python** and **Tkinter**. You can play against the computer, and the game will show the results with images and text.

## Features

- A simple and interactive GUI made with Tkinter.
- Random computer choices using Python's random library.
- Shows images for the player's choice and the computer's choice.
- Displays the winner after every round.

## How It Works

1. Pick your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) from the dropdown menu.
2. Click the **Play** button to make your move.
3. The game shows the computer's choice and declares the winner.

## What I Used

- **Python** for the logic and backend.
- **Tkinter** for the GUI.
- **Pillow** for resizing and displaying images.

## How to Run It

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the Pillow library if you donâ€™t have it:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
